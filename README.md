# 🟢 Aggressive Slimes

A physics-based 2D action puzzle game inspired by **Angry Birds**, built in **Unity** using C#.  
Players launch adorable (but deadly) slimes to destroy enemy structures.
> ⚠️ This project is a **prototype** and not a finished game. It was originally created as part of a Unity development exercise and will be revisited as a **Flash-style web demo** in the future.
